        <h2>OUTER-SPACE DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>What is outer space?</strong></p>
            <p>This is the vast expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere, where celestial bodies
                like planets, stars and gallaxies reside.
            </p>
            <p>It is a near-perfect vacuum, meaning there's very little
                matter present.
            </p>

                <p><strong>Massive:</strong> The sun is enormous, containing 99.86% 0f the total mass of our solar system.</p>
                <p><strong>Nuclear Fusion:</strong> The sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine
                to form helium, releasing immense amount of energy.</p>
                <p><strong>Heat and Light:</strong> This energy is emitted as heat and light, essential for life on Earth.</p>
                <p><strong>LIfe:</strong> The sun provides the heat and light necessary for life on Earth.</p>
